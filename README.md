### What is Big Data ?
Big Data is one of those terms that is very popular but somewhat challenging to define. 
It is a term which automatically establishes a hierarchy within data; classifying some as small and others as big.
But ironically, (_although it says in the name_) Big Data is not just data that is big, as you may find situations where small-sized data may be classified as Big Data.
In other words, there is more to Big Data than just its size, which although is important, is not the defining factor.
I believe that in order for any data to be considered Big Data, it needs to be unstructured, generated at a high frequency or rate, and have a lot of variety.
Thus, by this definition, large volumes of data that is structured, produced infrequently and has minimal variety would not be considered Big Data.
